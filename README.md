NDManager Plugins
=================

NDManager Plugins include a number of scripts and programs to automatically pre-process files recorded with data acquisition systems: file conversion (from vendor-specific, proprietary formats to open formats used by Klusters, Neuroscope and NDManager), channel resampling and reordering, high-pass filtering and spike detection, waveform feature extraction (PCA) for subsequent spike sorting, video transcoding and LED tracking, etc.
